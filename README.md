I have used these codes in my last project on "Deformation Mechanism of Pt Nanoparticle". These data post processing codes with python are built for processing LAMMPS data files. 


LAMMPS have coordination of each atom, total force, pressure, energy, and temperature of material on every time step.

By using the coordinates of each atom, we can find the area, and their displacement over time. By using force, we can calculate the stress.
